## Instructions

There are two ways to get up and running locally for development.

#### Docker Workflow

If you would like to work within the docker workflow, make sure to have Docker Desktop installed on Windows and Mac, or Docker and Docker-Compose on a linux distro. For more info on installing docker please visit the Docker [website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Once docker has been installed and set up:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Run `npm run local` from the root directory
4. Once you see `client_1 | ready - started server on http://localhost:3000` the app is ready to be opened in the browser (you will have to manually launch your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`)

> Note: It may take a little while to set up the docker containers the first time `docker-dev` is run.

#### Without Docker

If you wish to work without Docker you will need Node (we recommend >= 15.0.0) and Postgres (>= 13.0.0).

1. After forking and cloning this repository (steps 1 and 2 above), make sure Postgres is running
2. Create a database for local use and adjust the `.env.local` file to match your credentials
3. Run `npm install` from the root directory
4. Once install command is done run `npm run dev`
